## MSc Information Security @UCL pre-requisites

I have a complete [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shad1126/status/1415315055927771146?s=20&t=HNMo7ovWOazUydnLiBpJpw) which I wrote after I finished my MSc in 2021 where I have listed suggestions about some pre-requisites for the new cohorts.

## CERN Internship Application Tips

CERN Summer Student and Openlab internship recruitment is one of the most fair process I have seen. As someone on both sides of the table, where I was selected as an Openlab intern in 2017 and while working at CERN recruited a summer student in 2020, I have quite some experience to answer this from my perspective. The process works in a very different way as compared to many other internship recruitments. My main tips would be:
* Read about the organization and the research that is performed at CERN. You do not want to fill-in an application without knowing where and what you want to do.
* Write a good statement of purpose and highly suggest having your own portfolio website. Get good recommendation letters from your professors/previous employers.
* Have a genuine application and resume. It is easy to spot applications where students fake about their skills. 
* Be clear about what you bring to the table i.e. what skills do you have and how do you want to use them to contribute so the correct supervisor can read your application.
* Have keywords in your application and resume about the things you want to work on. For example, if you do DevOps and want to do the same, write keywords like `devops` and `CI/CD pipeline`, considering you know those things.
* Unlike the other interships like MITACS or DAAD, CERN does not give that much weightage about your GPA. But that does not mean the supervisors ignore those things completely.
* APPLY. Do not think that you cannot get in because of the competition. You would not get to know unless you apply.

Side note: CERN receives a few thousand applications for a very small number of students they select which obviously depends on the available funding. In 2017, CERN Openlab selected 37 students out of 1600 applications and this gets tougher every year. Do not be disheartened if you do not get selected. Another thing to keep in mind is that there should be a supervisor with an available project that matches your skillset. You do not just get selected because you have particular skills. So do not think you are not good enough if you do not get selected. Try again next year!

Lastly I just want to say - 'Good luck with your application! This will be the best summer of your life!' If you do end up as an intern at CERN, do ping me on socials and let me know how was your summer!
