## Things I wish I knew before starting a Ph.D.

There are a lot of things I’ve got to know during the last 6 months since I started my Ph.D. that I should have been prepared for: 

* Have a better understanding of the literature in the area and keep on updating it. It's difficult to find literature similar to your research because academics use different keywords and write the same things differently. The [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) papers aren’t indexed well because of citations, but they are all preprints waiting to be accepted at conferences. 
* Think in more scientific way then just technically writing code to solve a problem. Coming from a more technical background, it took me time to understand this.
* Think through the research questions on a broader level instead of a direct question. Eg. I have a simple question that I want to answer what is the distribution of x and y in SMS frauds and is not answered in literature but is not very scientific. So it would help if you polish and re-rewrite things to improve them.
* It will involve a lot of reading and writing. Technical stuff would be very less as one thinks. 
* Patience is going to be a critical factor in this journey. We think we know what we want to do and can get started and get done. However, other stakeholders/collaborators would have other priorities, so everything will take time. 
* Don’t talk much about your research with everyone outside your lab. Keep it broad and vague unless you have a publication because the world is not good. 
* A good Supervisor can make your life easier. I’m glad to have a good supervisor who helps me with everything.
* Your timeline for things changes compared to what you thought before starting the Ph.D.
* Thankfully I have a diary in which I take notes for every meeting I have with my supervisor (something I learned from someone's tweets before starting my research). Else one forgets things so fast because you are occupied with multiple things that you are doing. I have a different diary where I write meeting notes for the ones I have with collaborators/industry ones.
* Keep the expectations from your supervisor clear. It’s better for the long run. 
* Burnouts are a thing, so taking breaks and weekends for yourself will make you more productive (sometimes working over the weekend is ok because of deadlines).

## Consent in Collaborative Research (Especially for PhD students)

Six months into my Ph.D. journey and I have already made mistakes. Consent in collaborative research is something nobody teaches you but probably is something that everyone needs to know. Here are a few points I have learnt till now:

* If you are not the lead of the project, inform others before taking **any** step, including sending Freedom of Information (FoI) requests or the smallest step possible.
* Before starting a draft submission to a conference/journal, ask for permission from **all co-authors** (even if you are the first author).

## MSc Information Security @UCL pre-requisites

Congrats on receiving an offer and Welcome to UCL! I have a complete [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shad1126/status/1415315055927771146?s=20&t=HNMo7ovWOazUydnLiBpJpw) which I wrote after I finished my MSc in 2021 where I have listed suggestions about some pre-requisites for the new cohorts. Hopefully this should help you prepare and be ready to grind during the Master's.

## CERN Internship Application Tips

CERN Summer Student and Openlab internship recruitment is one of the most fair process I have seen. As someone on both sides of the table, where I was selected as an Openlab intern in 2017 and while working at CERN recruited a summer student in 2020, I have quite some experience to answer this from my perspective. The process works in a very different way as compared to many other internship recruitments. My main tips would be:
* Read about the organization and the research that is performed at CERN. You do not want to fill-in an application without knowing where and what you want to do.
* Write a good statement of purpose and highly suggest having your own portfolio website. Get good recommendation letters from your professors/previous employers.
* Have a genuine application and resume. It is easy to spot applications where students fake about their skills. 
* Be clear about what you bring to the table i.e. what skills do you have and how do you want to use them to contribute so the correct supervisor can read your application.
* Have keywords in your application and resume about the things you want to work on. For example, if you do DevOps and want to do the same, write keywords like `devops` and `CI/CD pipeline`, considering you know those things.
* Unlike the other interships like MITACS or DAAD, CERN does not give that much weightage about your GPA. But that does not mean the supervisors ignore those things completely.
* APPLY. Do not think that you cannot get in because of the competition. You would not get to know unless you apply.

Side note: CERN receives a few thousand applications for a very small number of students they select which obviously depends on the available funding. In 2017, CERN Openlab selected 37 students out of 1600 applications and this gets tougher every year. Do not be disheartened if you do not get selected. Another thing to keep in mind is that there should be a supervisor with an available project that matches your skillset. You do not just get selected because you have particular skills. So do not think you are not good enough if you do not get selected. Try again next year!

Lastly I just want to say - 'Good luck with your application! This will be the best summer of your life!' If you do end up as an intern at CERN, do ping me on socials and let me know how was your summer!

If you have any questions after reading this, feel free to create an [issue on this repo](https://github.com/sharad1126/Suggestions-And-Tips/issues) so I can answer it here for everyone to look at those questions and maybe even add it to this readme.
